# Excelerate_IITChicago_Internship

During my internship at Excelerate - IIT_Chicago, I was assigned the responsibility of a data analyst. My main objective was to analyze the data from the Marketing team regarding their Facebook ad campaigns for the Superhero U event. The Marketing team sought my expertise in identifying a campaign that could be discontinued to cut costs. To fulfill this task, I thoroughly examined the provided data, identified a campaign to recommend discontinuing, and created visually appealing data visualizations to present my findings to the Finance team.
