# Excelerate_IITChicago_Internship

During my internship at Excelerate - IIT_Chicago, I was assigned the responsibility of a data analyst. My main objective was to analyze the data from the Marketing team regarding their Facebook ad campaigns for the Superhero U event. The Marketing team sought my expertise in identifying a campaign that could be discontinued to cut costs. To fulfill this task, I thoroughly examined the provided data, identified a campaign to recommend discontinuing, and created visually appealing data visualizations to present my findings to the Finance team.

Final Suggestions:

After analyzing the various visualizations and their accompanying summaries, it is recommended to discontinue Campaign 3, titled "SHU_Students(Australia)," in order to make effective use of financial resources. Several factors support this recommendation:

Impressions: Campaign 3 has consistently lower impressions compared to other campaigns across all geographies. This suggests that the campaign is not effectively reaching the desired audience and may not be generating sufficient visibility and exposure.

Reach: The reach of Campaign 3 is significantly lower compared to other campaigns, indicating a limited reach and potential impact on the target audience. Particularly in Australia, the primary target geography for this campaign, the reach is notably lower compared to other campaigns targeting the same location.

Unique Link Clicks (ULC): Campaign 3 exhibits the lowest ULC among all campaigns, indicating a lack of effectiveness in engaging the audience to click on the provided links. The campaign's messaging or targeting strategy may not be resonating with the audience in Australia.

Click-Through Rate (CTR): The CTR for Campaign 3 is consistently lower compared to other campaigns, suggesting a lack of effectiveness in driving engagement and clicks. The lower CTR indicates that the ad content or targeting strategy may not be resonating well with the target audience, leading to a lower likelihood of users clicking on the ad links.

Cost Per Click (CPC): The CPC for Campaign 3 is significantly higher compared to other campaigns, indicating that it is less cost-effective in generating clicks. Allocating resources to campaigns with lower CPC would allow for more efficient use of financial resources.

Considering these factors, discontinuing Campaign 3 would allow for reallocating resources to more successful campaigns that are generating higher impressions, reaching a larger audience, and driving better engagement. This strategic decision aims to optimize the overall impact and cost-effectiveness of the ad campaigns.
